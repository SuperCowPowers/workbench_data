workbench_data
====

A place to store large files that are used either in workbench tests, examples or notebooks.

Current datasets in this repository include:

- Packages
  - **Bro-2.2-Linux-x86_64_flex.deb:** Debian package for Bro. In general the Bro debian package files are WAY too locked down with dependencies on exact versions of libc6 and python2.6. This is a more 'flexible' version.
- Memory Images
  - **examplar4.vmem (256 Meg):** The memory image is used in a great [JPH Securit Blog](http://jphsecurity.blogspot.com/2012/01/developing-baseline-approach-to.html) that outlines a nice 'Baseline Approach' to memory forensics. Resources like this are terrific and greatly appreciated by us and the community.
