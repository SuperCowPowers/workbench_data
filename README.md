workbench_data
====

This repository stores a set of 'pointers' to large files that are used either in workbench tests, examples or notebooks. Git is not where you want to store large files, but it is a nice place to communicate, organize and aggregate. So this repository is for organizing and communicating, the links contained within this readme point to a Public Shared Google Drive.

Current datasets pointed to by this repository include:

- Packages
  - **[Bro-2.2-Linux-x86_64_flex.deb (9 Meg)](https://googledrive.com/host/0B1QHlgNhJmssTzg4MmFhN3RIcDA):** 
  Debian package for Bro. In general the Bro debian package files are WAY too locked down with dependencies on exact versions of libc6 and python2.6. This is a more 'flexible' version.
- Memory Images
  - **[examplar4.vmem (256 Meg)](https://googledrive.com/host/0B1QHlgNhJmssWE5sNk1YblNKaXM):** The memory image is used in a great [JPH Security Blog](http://jphsecurity.blogspot.com/2012/01/developing-baseline-approach-to.html) that outlines a nice 'Baseline Approach' to memory forensics. Resources like this are terrific and greatly appreciated by us and the community.
